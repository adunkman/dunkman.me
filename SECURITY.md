## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you spot anything amiss, consider the impact of the issue. If the impact of disclosure is minimal, file an issue [on GitHub](https://github.com/adunkman/dunkman.me/issues/new/choose). However, if the details of the issue result in public disclosure of non-public information or may cause harm to others, contact me privately through email at adunkman@gmail.com. If desired, you can encrypt your message using [my public key](https://www.dunkman.me/key.asc).

Expect a response within a day unless I’m out of office, and I’ll follow-up with additional information with what to expect in that email. Unfortunately as this is a personal site, no monetary award is available for security vulnerabilities.
