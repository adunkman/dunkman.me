My general approach to digital communication is similar to that of standard mail — please do not be offended if I don’t return your message. I’m most responsive on Twitter for quick touch communication, and feel free to ask a question publicly or send me an email.

## Privately

If you’re interested in reaching me privately, encrypt your message before sending it by your method of choice — be sure to let me know how to find your public key to encrypt my reply if desired.
