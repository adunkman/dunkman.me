My general approach to digital communication is similar to that of standard mail — please do not be offended if I don’t return your message. I’m most responsive on Signal for quick touch communication, and feel free to ask a question publicly or send me an email.

## Encrypted messaging

If you’re interested in reaching me privately outside of Signal, encrypt your message before sending it by your method of choice — be sure to let me know how to find your public key to encrypt my reply if desired.

## Social media

While it's not the best way to contact me for more professional purposes, feel free to follow along my public social media profiles.

## Digital payments

If you're looking to send money my way for a group collection (dining out, etc), here are my various repayment methods. Be sure to note what you're paying for in the memo field if it's not obvious.
