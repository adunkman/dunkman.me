<p>I often write code in and around the Internet, and am especially interested in how the <a href="https://github.com/adunkman">code I write</a> impacts how people interact with each other.</p>

<p>I <a href="/talks/">speak occasionally</a> on subjects which I find fascinating. Often they’re about JavaScript, but sometimes they’re not. Get in touch if you’d like to <a href="/talks/#contact">hear me speak at your next event</a>.</p>

<p>I have a low tolerance for insensitivity in design (and in people), and prefer products and services that are transparent over those which beg you to recognize their design.</p>

<p>I believe that efforts of diversity are misplaced attempts at inclusivity. The seeds of inclusivity are planted in leveraging your privilege to help those less fortunate than you, rather than pretending your privilege does not exist.</p>

<p>I’m most responsive on <a href="https://twitter.com/adunkman">Twitter</a> but if you’re interested in engaging in longer dialog, perhaps <a href="https://github.com/adunkman/ask">asking me a question</a> would be more fitting. Don’t be shy! If you’re interested in reaching me privately, <a href="https://keybase.io/encrypt#adunkman">encrypt your message</a>.</p>

<p>I also <a href="/blog/">occasionally blog</a>, mainly on subjects I find hard to google.</p>
