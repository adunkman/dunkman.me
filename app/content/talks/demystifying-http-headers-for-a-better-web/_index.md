title: Demystifying HTTP Headers for a Better Web
date: "2015-03-28"
summary: Ever wonder exactly what combination of Cache-Control, Last-Modified, Expires, ETag, Vary, and Pragma headers will keep your content cached by browsers just long enough? And what exactly is a HTTP 304 anyway? In this talk, you’ll learn the history behind the available HTTP caching headers, what their values mean, and how browsers and proxies react. You’ll learn the best practices on client cache invalidation, the benefits of sending a Not Modified response, and briefly talk about the changes in HTTP 2.0 (SPDY) around caching — and then you’ll put your new-found header skills to the test!
