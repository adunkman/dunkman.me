title: UX Design for Developers
date: "2013-05-03"
summary: "So you’ve heard this buzzword “user experience” before, probably out of some hipster’s beard-mouth. But what does it actually mean? We’ll cover the basics of what it means to design software for user experience, including human factors in design, the user-centered design process, and a focus on human-computer interactions. Spoiler alert: it has very little to do with flashy graphics."
