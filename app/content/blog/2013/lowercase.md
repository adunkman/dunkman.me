Located one block away from Capitol Street in Washington, D.C., "lowercase" would be a typography-themed restaurant.

Each menu item would be named after a font and styled to be like the font. For example, Helvetica would be a clean dish cut with straight lines and very square --- say, a melt with the crusts trimmed served with a side of squared watermelon?

The menu items would be served on a plate shaped as (or painted with, for cost savings and practicality) a distinguishable letter from that font --- or maybe just the font's ampersand. Hipsters seem to like ampersands.

Anybody want to go into business with me? :)
