Like many professional developers, I find myself at my fair share of technology conferences --- some organized by conference veterans, some by conference noobies. I can deal with a cold hot lunch or running out of coffee, but there’s one mistake that we just can’t keep making --- both for *the sake of our community and for our sanity*.

Organizers and speakers must **stick to the contract**:

 - The speaker will show up to the conference with the agreed upon talk prepared to fill the scheduled time.

 - The organizer will give the speaker the scheduled time to give the prepared talk.

I’ve witnessed talks get cut by over 25% twice: as a speaker at [Nebraska Code Camp](http://nebraskacodecamp.com) and just now as an attendee of [Dustin Black](https://twitter.com/dustinlblack)’s excellent overview of [GlusterFS](http://www.gluster.org/) at [FOSSCON](http://fosscon.org/). It sucks. Not just for the speaker, the organizers, and the attendees; but the community as a whole.

 - **As a speaker**, you’ve been robbed of the chance to share your well-prepared ideas and instead rush through your content at breakneck speed.

 - **As an attendee**, you’ve been robbed of the chance to fully absorb the content --- and usually robbed of your chance to hang out afterward and chat.

 - **As an organizer**, you’re just trying to hold it all together as closely to the schedule as possible --- and suddenly you’re in the awkward position of cutting off someone’s talk.

 - **As the community**, we lose the enthusiasm of great speakers and great minds to share their ideas.

So, can we just all agree to show up a little extra early, plan twice as twice as much time for registration as needed, and keep to the schedule? If we *must* adjust the schedule, at very least let’s take time evenly from all speakers?
