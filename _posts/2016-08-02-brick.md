This talk was a summary of “[Evidence for a Collective Intelligence Factor in the Performance of Human Groups](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ab/Salon/research/Woolley_et_al_Science_2010-2.pdf)”, by Anita Williams Woolley, Christopher F. Chabris, Alex Pentland, Nada Hashmi, and Thomas W. Malone.

It also drew content from “[What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html?_r=0)”, by Charles Duhigg for the New York Times.

Slides [are available on SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/adunkman/how-to-use-a-brick-a-study-of-collective-intelligence), however I would recommend reading the above cited resources before referencing these slides (they’re smarter people than me!).

Thanks for listening!
